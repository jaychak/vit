# Vision Transformer and Vision Transformer - Masked Autoencoder Playground

In this repo, I have several ipython notebooks for playing with ViT and ViT-MAE models.
I have both training, fine-tuning and linear probing code in stand-alone notebooks.

The ViT is from the paper
- [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)
The ViT-MAE is from the paper
- [Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)

## Disclaimers

This repo has borrowed from 
https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial15/Vision_Transformer.html for the ViT
and https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae for the ViT-MAE
